This week took a significantly longer time learning the material and watching the videos for sure. There's a lot more meat here than in week 2, and it was a lot of fun diving in and learning more about JavaScript. Although I have taken MART120, it has been a few years so it's basically all being relearned by this point.

When I asked ChatGPT to make a choose your own adventure game in HTML and JavaScript using a custom CSS, it had quite the time with the project. I may have said this before, but AI is great for making really basic code but really bad at creating more complex things that need more time to understand, or web pages that you would have to refer back to previous code in multiple different areas. So unsurprisingly, when trying to make a choose your own adventure game, it had a hard time keeping all the names the same and referring back to said variables.
