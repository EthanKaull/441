I had a really fun time expanding my knowledge on different functions and variables this week! It's cool diving into a bit more of the meat that comes with functions. Being able to use text boxes in my new "choose your own adventure" story is giving way more freedom than the last one which just had 2 buttons you could press.

When it came to the AI portion of this week, it felt like Deja Vu. Asking the AI to create a choose your own adventure story was pretty similar to last week, where it did really well on creating the basic bones of the code but had a hard time remembering and calling back to the names it made for variables. Though this week it was extra hard as I was trying to force it to use specifics like having parameters and trying to have it implement switch loops. In the end, I couldn't find a way to tell it how to properly create this game, so I was left with broken AI code.
