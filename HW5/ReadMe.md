This week was super fun! I learned a large plethora of different things, though I personally appreciated the quick lesson on debugging. I feel like thats like, 50% of what I'm doing when I'm coding (either for this class or some personal project) and having the correct knowledge and tools to tackle these different problems are going to make a world of difference.

When I sent in the instructions for this week's homework to ChatGPT, it had a bit of a hard time figuring out the hidden pictures portion. I gave it all the images it needed, but for some reason it couldn't grasp the thought process of making the original photos the back of the card, and the new photo the pictures of the fantastical beasts. After a few back and forth conversations, it eventually figured out the matching game portion, though it was so littered with syntax errors after continuous updates that it wasn't usable at all by the end.
